    <p>We've been working on an ERP implementation at work for the past two or three months and up until a few days ago
        we have been making steady progress. Currently, we are extracting data from 3 mssql databases into another mssql
        database that is used as a staging database through a set of stored procedures. Here we are translating the data
        to fit the ERP data model. From the staging database we then use another set of stored procedures to move the
        data to an Oracle 11g database via a linked server. This approach worked fine until we started to move tables
        with records reaching over 100,000 and saw this error:</p>
    <blockquote><p>SQL Server Database Error: The OLE DB provider “OraOLEDB.Oracle” for linked server “CONV” could not
        INSERT INTO table “[OraOLEDB.Oracle]“</p></blockquote>
    <p>I Google'd around for a bit looking for configuration hints but was unable to find anything helpful.</p>

    <p>Rather than moving the data from mssql to Oracle, we reversed our approach and decided
        to try Oracle Database Gateway for SQL Server.</p>

    <h3>Gateway Installation</h3>

    <p>Download the gateway from <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/database/enterprise-edition/downloads/112010-win64soft-094461.html">here</a>.
    </p>

    <p>Execute and complete the gateway setup on the Oracle database server. There's not much to say about the
        installation except for the part where it will ask you to setup a listener. I chose to skip this step and reuse
        the listener that is already running on the same box.</p>

    <h3>Configuration</h3>

    <p>We basically have 4 pieces to configure, the gateway, listener, local naming, and the database link. Whenever I
        start working with new technologies I like to take a step back and take a 10,000 foot view of what I'm working
        with. Here are the moving parts that we are concerned with. We have a <a
                href="http://download.oracle.com/docs/cd/E11882_01/server.112/e17120/ds_concepts002.htm#ADMIN12084">DATABASE
            LINK</a> that is defined in the database referencing the local naming method to the gateway. The local
        naming method is defined in the $ORACLE_HOME/network/admin/tnsnames.ora file of the database. The local naming
        method entry uses the SID that is defined at the listener. The listener is configured to make the gateway
        available over an IP address or local IPC. In our case we're using IPC since the gateway and database are on the
        same box. That sums up what we need to do.</p>

    <p>If you installed the gateway on the same box as the Oracle database server, you will end up with multiple
        ORACLE_HOMEs, one for the database installation and one for the gateway installation. We'll refer to the as
        ORACLE_HOME_DB and ORACLE_HOME_GW respectively.</p>

    <h3>Gateway</h3>

    <p>The gateway configuration is pretty simple. You will create a new init{MSSQLDB}.ora file for each SQL Server
        database you want to make available through the gateway. Create a new .ora file
        $ORACLE_HOME_GW\dg4msql\adm\init{MSSQLDB}.ora. The contents of the file will look something like this:</p>
<pre>#
# HS init parameters
#
HS_FDS_CONNECT_INFO=[SERVER_NAME]//MSSQL_DB
HS_FDS_TRACE_LEVEL=OFF
HS_FDS_RECOVERY_ACCOUNT=RECOVER
HS_FDS_RECOVERY_PWD=RECOVER</pre>
    <p>The name of the init{MSSQLDB}.ora file is important. When you name your file you must replace the {MSSQLDB} with
        the name of the SID used in listener.ora file. Below we are using <em>dg4dmssqldb</em> as the sid so your file
        will be named <em>initdg4dmssqldb.ora</em>. Be sure to match the case as well.</p>

    <h3>Listener</h3>

    <p>The listener will make the gateway available over IP or IPC. If you chose to setup a new listener during the
        gateway installation, you will need to update $ORACLE_HOME_GW\network\admin\listener.ora otherwise you're
        listener may be configured here $ORACLE_HOME_DB\network\admin\listener.ora. Its up to you to make sure you are
        updating the right one. Here's what mine looks like after making the changes:</p>
<pre>LISTENER =
  (DESCRIPTION_LIST =
    (DESCRIPTION =
      (ADDRESS = (PROTOCOL = TCP)(HOST = oracle-server.mycomany.com)(PORT = 1521))
      (ADDRESS = (PROTOCOL = IPC)(KEY = EXTPROC1521))
    )
  )

ADR_BASE_LISTENER = D:\app\oracle

SID_LIST_LISTENER =
  (SID_LIST =
   (SID_DESC =
      (SID_NAME = dg4dmssqldb)
      (PROGRAM = D:\app\oracle\product\11.2.0\gateways\bin\dg4msql)
    )
  )

SUBSCRIBE_FOR_NODE_DOWN_EVENT_LISTENER=OFF</pre>
    <h3>Local Naming</h3>

    <p>Next is to configure local naming for the Oracle database instance. When you define the database link, the db
        server will use local naming to locate the gateway. Here's the snippet of the local naming method entry, notice
        we're using the IPC protocol rather than IP.</p>
<pre>dg4dmssqldb =
  (DESCRIPTION =
    (ADDRESS = (PROTOCOL = IPC)(KEY = EXTPROC1521))
    (CONNECT_DATA = (SID = dg4dmssqldb))
	(HS=OK)
    )
  )</pre>
    <h3>DATABASE LINK</h3>

    <p>That last step is to configure and test the db link….</p>
<pre>CREATE PUBLIC DATABASE LINK 'mssqldb' CONNECT TO 'mssql_user' IDENTIFIED BY 'mssql_pass' USING '
dg4dmssqldb'</pre>
    <p>and test it….</p>
    <pre>SELECT * FROM MSSQLTABLE@</pre>
    <h3>Wrap up</h3>

    <p>So far we're seeing fast response times for our queries going through the gateway. Hopefully the gateway will
        allow us to move our data from the staging environment to the ERP at the same pace before we started running
        into issues with the linked server. Actually, I'm surprised by the performance of gateway, we're able to move a
        table that is 58 columns wide and contains 138,000 records in about 13-14 seconds.</p>

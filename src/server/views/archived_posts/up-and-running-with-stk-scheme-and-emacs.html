    <p>Today I started to watch The Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs (SICP) course at Academic Earth.
        Academic Earth provides free access to video courses from top universities like UC Berkeley where this course is
        taught. The course is based on the popular computer science book Structure and Interpretation of Computer
        Programs. The professor of the course, Brian Harvey, claims it to be the best computer science book you'll ever
        read, not the first time I've heard that. The book is available online for free, just Google <a
                href="http://www.google.com/search?q=SICP">SCIP</a>.</p>

    <p>The purpose of this blog post is to get you up and running quickly with the dialect of scheme the course uses
        called STk and the emacs editor. My Linux chops are not strong at all so it took me a couple of days of spare
        time to Google and setup my scheme environment.</p>

    <p>I tried my best to capture and list the references I used below at the end of this post.</p>

    <p>I'm running a fresh install of 32-bit Ubuntu Server 10.4.</p>

    <h3>Installing STk</h3>

    <p>These steps were taken directly from UCB Scheme page <a
            href="http://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~scheme/precompiled/Linux/">here</a>.</p>

    <p>First step is to install the Korn shell (ksh) which is required to install STk.</p>
    <pre>sudo apt-get install ksh</pre>
    <p>Download STk from UC Berkeley.</p>
    <pre>wget http://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~scheme/precompiled/Linux/STk-4.0.1-ucb1.3.6.i386.rpm</pre>
    <p>Install Alien.</p>
    <pre>sudo apt-get install alien</pre>
    <p>Remove the stk package name conflict between UCB stk and stk the sound processing library.</p>
<pre>sudo aptitude remove stk
sudo apt-get upgrade
sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
</pre>
    <p>Run alien to convert the rpm into the debian package format.</p>
    <pre>sudo alien -d STk-4.0.1-ucb1.3.6.i386.rpm</pre>
    <p>Install STk using the newly created .deb file.</p>
    <pre>sudo dpkg -i stk_4.0.1-1_i386.deb</pre>
    <p>Now you should be able to run the STk interpreter.</p>
    <pre>stk</pre>

    <h3>Short Introduction to Emacs</h3>

    <p>The primary motivation for this blog post is this section about Emacs. While watching the first video in the SICP
        course I noticed the instructor using a split screen text editor and was curious to learn more about it. I will
        gently introduce basic emacs commands and finish up with showing you how to setup emacs with a split screen. In
        the top pane we'll write simple function and in the bottom pane we'll run the function in “shell” buffer.</p>

    <p>Emacs definitely takes some getting use to if you're not a keyboard jockey, hopefully you can hang in there.</p>

    <p>If you don't have emacs installed, you can install it by running the following command:</p>
    <pre>sudo apt-get install emacs23</pre>
    <p>Launch emacs by typing the command:</p>
    <pre>emacs square.scm</pre>
    <p>Once emacs is up and running type the following scheme function in the editor.</p>
    <pre>(define (square x) (* x x))</pre>
    <p>Save the buffer using the following command.</p>
    <pre>Ctrl-x, Ctrl-s</pre>
    <p>You have seem a message that says “Wrote /path/to/square.scm”. Now we want to split the editor into two
        horizontal windows. One pane will display the scheme function and the other will display a command prompt where
        we can launch the STk interpreter. In order to accomplish this, we start a new “shell” buffer.</p>
    <pre>Alt-x, and type "shell" (without the parenthesis)</pre>
    <p>Next up is to split the window horizontally. This split the window horizontally with the same document in both
        panes.</p>
    <pre>Ctrl-x, 2</pre>
    <p>Now you'll want to switch focus between the two panes. </p>
    <pre>Ctrl-x, o  (thats an 'o', not a zero)</pre>
    <p>Switch focus to the pane you want to view the scheme function in and then type:</p>
    <pre>Ctrl-x, b</pre>
    <p>Switch focus to the pane containing the STk interpreter using the Ctrl-x, o command and then load the scheme
        function.</p>
    <pre>STk&gt;(load "scheme.scm")</pre>
    <p>Now that the function is loaded into the interpreter you should be able use the square function.</p>
<pre>STk&gt; (square 5)
25
STk&gt;
</pre>
    <p>And there you have it, a split horizontal pane in emacs where you can view both the STk interpreter and the
        source code of the function.</p>
